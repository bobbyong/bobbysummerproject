          <h2>About</h2>
          <br>
	      Thank you very much for the support towards TuitionX.com. Here are some FAQ on what TuitionX is about (The "I" in the following refers to Bobby):
	      <br><br>

		<p><h4>Q: Why am I building TuitionX.com?</h4>
		A: While reflecting on my education journey, I realised that I was able to achieve what I achieved only because I have received many opportunities in life. Among those are the chance to be educated by some really great teachers – be they in school or in private tuition. I realised many of me peers do not have this opportunity and this creates an education inequality within our Malaysian education system. I seek to reduce this education inequality by providing a free, online tuition centre to help fellow Malaysian school students learn better.</p>

		<p><h4>Q: Is there an academic paper highlighting this education inequality problem in Malaysia?</h4>
		A: Yes, I stumbled onto a research paper from the Asian Development Bank on the <a href="http://bit.ly/MQDY96" target="_blank">shadow education industry in Asia.</a></p>

		<p><h4>Q: Am I against private tuition in general?</h4>
		A: No, but I do believe that paying for private tuition should not be a necessary step in gaining academic excellence and I see a worrying trend where almost all urban school students pressure their parents to fork out money to pay for tuition (or perhaps the other way round where parents pressure their children to go for tuition). I believe this is an unhealthy development for the country. I am all for private tuition if the student really needs the extra help AND the quality of the private tuition is of a high standard. However, many of these tuition centres are of questionable quality. Look how easy it is to start a tuition business by yourself. Any Tom, Dick and Harry can start calling themselves a tuition teacher. I have a friend who did not do too well in SPM Add Maths (and has no further university qualifications) and he once gained a job as a SPM Mathematics tutor in a neighbourhood tuition centre even though he has no passion in teaching at all! His reason for doing so? The salary of a tuition teacher is really good. I think students and parents are wasting a lot of money if tuition teachers are of dubious quality. It is very difficult to establish the quality of a tuition teacher and many people make their decisions on which tuition centres to attend based on advertisements and hearsay with no obvious way to check the facts.</p>

		<p><h4>Q: Is this a copy of Khan Academy?</h4>
		A: Yes and No. The idea is definitely inspired by Khan Academy but TuitionX has been developed with a combination of learning experiences adopted from several other online education models. It is very similar to Khan Academy now because our Maths and Science syllabus is still in English. Once our Maths and Science syllabus revert back to the Malay language, it will be very vastly different from Khan Academy. Besides, there are many other subjects taught in Malay such as Sejarah, Geografi, Principal Akauns etc that one cannot find on Khan Academy and TuitionX hopes to fill this gap. The next differentiating factor are the future features that will be implemented on TuitionX and it will be described more in the following Q&A.</p>

		<p><h4>Q: What are the future features of TuitionX?</h4>
		A: Here are a brief description of features that will be implemented on TuitionX:<br>
		- Online SPM past year questions with video solutions<br>
		- A page where students can submit questions to be answered by other students/tutors in video formats. This is where the peer-to-peer method comes in. Students learn better when they teach their fellow peers what they understand, so here they may submit video solutions of their method in solving a certain problem. Otherwise, the team of tutors can submit video solutions to interesting questions<br>
		- Crowd-sourced study notes – basically a wiki with notes to help memorise examination facts. Remember all those mnemonics/memorising tricks that we used to memorise Sejarah facts for SPM? With this feature, everyone can share their way of memorising examination facts on TuitionX thereby creating a massive study note for all<br>
		- Flash-card style memorising technique/game to test memory<br>
		- Exchange of trial exam papers from different schools/states<br>
		- Gamification ideas to make learning fun</p>

		<p><h4>Q: How do I plan to bring TuitionX to the rural students in Malaysia?</h4>
		A: At the moment, TuitionX is focusing effort on creating the educational content and testing the concept with internet-savvy urban students. Once the concept has been validated, the idea is to reach out to rural students by tying up with rural schools to use their computer labs or cyber cafe or with TMNet to create an ‘Internet Bergerak’ (I believe there is already such an initiative? Someone please send me a link if you know of such stuff).</p>

		<p><h4>Q: Is this a competitor to TeachForMalaysia?</h4>
		A: No, the idea is inspired by TeachForMalaysia where university graduates spend 2 years of their lives after university to teach in rural secondary schools in Malaysia. TFM is a great idea and I would highly recommend university graduates to sign up with this programme. Many of us may not be able to afford to spend 2 years of our lives teaching but would still like to contribute to help other disadvantaged students and TuitionX hopes to provide this platform for university graduates wishing to do good during their free time.</p>

		<p><h4>Q: Why provide free tuition?</h4>
		A: Basic economics taught us the following principle – in a perfectly competitive market, the Price charged for a product should equate to the Marginal Cost of producing the product ie P = MC. The Marginal Cost of providing a high-quality tuition lesson over the Internet, once it has been recorded (the recording and web development cost is the Fixed Cost and should not be included nto this equation) is nearly zero. By this basic economic principle, anything that has zero MC should thus have a Price of zero and hence the only logical thing to charge for this online tuition centre is a price of zero!</p>

		<p><h4>Q: Do I need sophisticated technology to create lessons?</h4>
		A: No. If you have an iPad, all you need to do is get yourself a stylus and download a screencasting app. Otherwise the same lesson can also be created using a computer with other screencasting softwares.</p>

		<p><h4>Q: How can I contribute to TuitionX?</h4>
		A: If you would like to contribute to this project but do not know how you can do so, drop me an email at bobby@tuitionx.com or Facebook message me and we can discuss a role for you to play in this project. There are many interesting things that we can work together on TuitionX.</p>
